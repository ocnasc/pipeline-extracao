      "{TITLE}\nCIP WASHING\n\nThe machine is provided with a CIP washing device that is intended for washing and sanitizing the parts in contact with the filling liquid.  \nTypes of washing:  \n• RINSE ONLY: consists of a simple washing with water;  \n• SANITATION: consists of a complete washing of the plant with the use of a washing product;  \n• FLOODING: consists of filling all machines with an appropriate cleaning solution to keep them clean during periods of inactivity (i.e. at night or on weekends). The filling can only be carried out after sanitizing the system.  \n\nSANITATION  \nThe machine sanitation cycle is defined as the succession of stages of washing, rinsing and drainage in the manner and time required to ensure complete cleaning of the filler and the dramatic reduction of microbial load and varies depending on many parameters, such as the type of filled product, the type of plant, environmental conditions (higher temperatures require more frequent sanitations) modes of use of the filling line.  \nThe sanitization cycles can be 3 steps (ref.1-3, usually used for frequent washing and sanitization cycles, occasionally alternated with 5 steps), 5 steps (ref.1-5, for more complete sanitization cycle services) or 7 steps (ref.1-7, for sanitization cycle services after bottling of more problematic products (i.e. milk-based).  \n\n1. In the case of hot filling, it is necessary to perform initial rinsing at the temperature used for filling the product and then gradually decrease it until the mains temperature is reached. If the filling is cold, simply rinse at the mains temperature. This first rinse allows the elimination of most of the product residues from the piping and its duration will vary depending on the product that has been bottled previously (of course, if the product is water, rinsing will be very brief).  \n2. Carry out a cycle with soda (1.5%-2% at 80°-85°C) to permanently eliminate product residues left after rinsing.  \n3. Perform a rinse cycle with water at mains temperature until the soda (or acid) is completely eliminated.  \n4. Carry out a cycle with acid (usually nitric 1% at 30°C or phosphoric max 1% at 30°C) or with sanitizer (PAA-based chemical such as P3 -Oxonia or Divosan Mezzo).  \n5. Carry out a new cycle with soda (1.5%-2% at 80°-85°C).  \n6. Perform a cycle with sanitizer (PAA-based chemical such as P3 -Oxonia or Divosan Mezzo).  \n7. Once the cycle with acid or sanitizer has been completed, perform a final rinse with water at mains temperature. This rinse, usually the last to be carried out before the new production, will continue until acid or sanitizer value corresponds to that decided by the customer.  \n\n{\"image\": true}  \n6.3.2  \nCIP WASHING  \n6-6  \nFQ12Z007C  \n6  \nMACHINE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS  ",
      "{TITLE}\nMACHINE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following chart summarizes concentrations, temperatures and cycle duration of some products to be used for washing that can be used during sanitization. This chart is to be considered as a purely indicative and non-binding trace.\n\nPRODUCTS for  \nWASHING\n- Caustic Soda (NaOH)\n  - CONCENTRATION: 2%\n  - TEMPERATURE: 80 °C\n  - DURATION expressed in minutes: 30\n- Nitric Acid (HNO3)\n  - CONCENTRATION: 1%\n  - TEMPERATURE: 30 °C\n  - DURATION expressed in minutes: 20\n- phosphoric acid (H3PO4)\n  - CONCENTRATION: 1%\n  - TEMPERATURE: 30 °C\n  - DURATION expressed in minutes: 20\n- PAA Solution  \n  - CONCENTRATION: 250 - 300 ppm\n  - TEMPERATURE: 20 °C\n  - DURATION expressed in minutes: 20\n- Hot water\n  - CONCENTRATION: 95°c\n  - DURATION expressed in minutes: 45\n\nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nDangerous substances (acids, soda, etc.) are used during sanitation cycles and dangerous temperatures are reached. Always take all appropriate precautions. In the event of accidental contact with the sanitising products, rinse thoroughly with water or, if available, with detergent substances provided. In any case, immediately consult a doctor.\n\n6.3.3 COP WASHING\nThe machine can be equipped with the COP washing system, which allows the machine to be washed externally automatically.
